## Homeworks
Homeworks are due at *11:59pm Eastern Time* on the listed due date. You have a total of *48 late hours* without penalty[^latehours]. Exceptions and extensions can be given in exceptional circumstances; please contact the course instructor to discuss your circumstances.

Collaboration on homeworks is allowed, though the final words used in the assignment must be your own. When collaborating with other students you are required to state at the beginning of the submission the names of the students you collaborated with.

All homework submissions must be typeset (no handwritten submissions). We highly recommend writing in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) or [Typst](https://typst.app/). You might find [this LaTeX solution template](notes/solution_template.tex) helpful to get started.

[^latehours]: For example, you could submit homework 1 three hours late, homework 2 ten hours late, and homework 5 thirty-five hours late and receive no penalty. Homeworks submitted at any time past the hour count as consuming a late hour. For example, submitting a homework at 1:00am Eastern Time the day after it is due would consume two late hours. Homeworks submitted after all 48 late hours have been consumed will be worth 0.
